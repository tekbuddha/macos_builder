## osxbuilder

This is a highly opinionated setup script that automatically configures my MacOS systems to a "usable" state following a clean MacOS install. This gets me as pretty close to useable in a realively short period of time.

### Dependencies

This script makes use of XCode's Command Line Tools (namely, `git`, `gcc`, and other build-type tools). The quickest way to get this installed is to open `Terminal.app` and issue a quick `gcc`, which will then prompt you to install the CLT package.

### How To Use

1. Select 'Download Zip' from the Github [page](https://github.com/tekbuddha/osxbuilder), `git clone`, or work from your own fork. 
1. `bash ./osxbuilder.sh`
1. Profit!
